## Node Js Backend Structure

#### About Project
Recently I have started working on a new project and the issue that I faced was spending a lot of time building the project structure based on the best practices, especially with javascript that has a lot of approaches and bad parts, I couldn't find any place that wraps the best practices into a single project ,so I decided to make it on my own.

In this repository, I don't aim to provide an optimal solution as each project have its own necessity but to help anyone that is starting with a node js project and can't find any inspiration on how to start building the project to take this project as the starting point.

Some of the good practices followed in this repository:
- Async/Await support
- Pug
- Error Handling
- Open Api Specification implemented through mongoose
- Enviroment variables to hold configuration values .env file
- OOP (object oriented programming)

#### How to start the project
first you clone the project using the following command :

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/NevetsKuro/Node_Structure_Template.git`

2. Install node version 14.7.X

3. Go to root folder and run `npm install`

4. Go to `config > mongodb.js` and edit mongo src url

5. Finally you run `npm start`

6. New Future improvements will be coming soon

please feel free to ⭐ happy programming ✌️
